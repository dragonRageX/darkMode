# darkMode
Added a super cool **Dark Mode Toggler** feature with ReactJS!
***
I added the most in-thing and sought after *UI* feature of *2019*... Yes, you guessed it right - **Dark Mode**!!! I added this feature to my React static site.  
It works with a toggler, switching between the **Light** and **Dark** modes.   
For anyone who needs it, [here](https://www.figma.com/file/YO4sb6V4sEYzncsldwODf8/ReactFacts-Light%2FDark-Modes-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design) is the Figma design file link to this project
